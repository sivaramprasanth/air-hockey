This is a two-player game. There are two paddles and a puck. The left-paddle (Player 1) can be moved using W, A, S, D keys and the right-paddle (Player 2)can be moved by the arrow keys. The puck hits the upper and lower boundaries and gets reflected and if it goes inside the goal, it is a point for the other person. The person who scores 10 goals first is the winner.
